              According to research [1], there is a GPS based messaging system
              for taking care of elders. There are numerous GPS-based location

              Finder On-Line. The basic service may be activated on any cell

              Some research has been done to find student residential distance
              for an educational organization [1]. They monitored details of
              student residence locations to get a good idea about their
              location details. The system evaluates the distance from the
              student residence destination's address rather than using
              locations. It paints a clearer picture of the marketing strategy
              for the upcoming year. The clustering method k-means can be used
              to cluster the locations in order to produce more accurate results
              when using the Haversines formula to calculate distance. The
              latitude and longitude provided by Google Maps API are used to
              locate each student's residence, and the lowest, highest, and
              average distances are then displayed. Organizations ought to
              concentrate more on specific geographic areas where better
              advertising can be offered to raise the entrance rate using visual
              representation.

              The main cause of road accidents and aggravated traffic congestion
              is the violation and deliberate violation of traffic rules by
              drivers. The efficiency of traffic enforcers in arresting these
              traffic violators has become a problem. As there are no current
              policies or technology in place that can invariably reduce, if not
              eliminate, the rate of traffic violations, undisciplined drivers
              tend to ignore the rules. This research background literature
              discusses the various image processing techniques that have been
              developed or enhanced to identify and address traffic violations,
              with a focus on real-time systems and plate character recognition
              technologies. By gaining a deeper understanding of these
              techniques and their applications, it is hoped that societies can
              reduce the impact of traffic violations and improve overall road
              safety.The consequences of traffic violations are both immediate
              and far-reaching, impacting not only the violators themselves but
              also other road users and the community at large. Traffic
              violations often lead to accidents, property damage, injuries, and
              fatalities, as well as increased congestion and delays. These
              issues result in considerable economic costs, environmental
              impacts, and diminished quality of life for individuals living in
              affected areas [1].Given the severity of these consequences, there
              is a pressing need for effective solutions to identify and address
              traffic violations. Efficient traffic enforcement systems can help
              ensure that drivers adhere to traffic rules, thus reducing the
              likelihood of accidents and congestion. By identifying and
              apprehending traffic violators, these systems can serve as a
              deterrent to other potential offenders, promoting a culture of
              road safety and compliance. Recent research and trends have
              focused on developing or enhancing various image processing
              techniques, which can help identify and address traffic
              violations. These techniques aim to analyze the types of
              violations that occur on the road and [2]detect infractions in
              real-time. Examples of applications include object and image
              recognition, which can be employed to detect vehicles violating
              traffic rules or to [3]identify specific license plate information
              [2] [4].One of the most commonly used methods for plate
              recognition is Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR technology
              is capable of converting printed or handwritten text into
              machine-readable text, allowing for the efficient identification
              and processing of license plate information. This technology has
              become instrumental in detecting and apprehending traffic
              violators, enabling enforcers to take prompt action against
              offenders [4]

              The number of accidents and traffic congestion have significantly
              increased due to reckless driving by three-wheeler drivers. Most
              are the result of male drivers' behavior. According to the World
              Health Organization (WHO), road accidents kill 1.3 million people
              every year and between 20-50 million people suffer non-fatal
              injuries [1]. Speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol and
              other psychoactive substances, failure to wear motorcycle helmets,
              seat belts and child restraints, unsafe road infrastructure,
              unsafe vehicles, and inadequate post-accident care contribute to
              the number of fatal accidents., inadequate enforcement of traffic
              laws [1]. Three-wheelers are the second most registered vehicle in
              Sri Lanka among developing countries in South Asia [1]. Though
              three-wheelers are popular in the country, according to previous
              studies, it has had a severe impact on the safety of drivers as
              well as passengers. The graph below shows a summary of the
              accidents that happened in Sri Lanka in the last years according
              to WHO.
